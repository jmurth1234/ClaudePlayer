2025-03-01 10:56:13,891 [INFO] CLAUDE'S THINKING:
2025-03-01 10:56:13,891 [INFO]   I can see a frame from what appears to be a Pokémon game, specifically from the Game Boy era (likely Pokémon Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, or Crystal). The image shows:

1. A player character (red/orange sprite) standing in what looks like a house or building
2. The interior has wooden floors, furniture (tables, a bed), and electronic equipment/appliances along the walls
3. This appears to be the player's home or a house in one of the towns

Based on the sprite color and interior design, this is most likely from Pokémon Gold, Silver, or Crystal (Generation 2 games), and the player is in their house in New Bark Town at the start of the game.

First, I should set the game:

2025-03-01 10:56:13,891 [INFO]   I can see this is a Pokémon game from the Game Boy Color era. The character sprite and interior design indicate this is Pokémon Gold, Silver, or Crystal (Generation 2). I can see the player character inside what appears to be their home in New Bark Town, which is the starting location of these games.

Let me set the game and establish our initial goal:

2025-03-01 10:56:20,963 [INFO]   I'm looking at a Pokémon Gold/Silver/Crystal game. The player character is standing in what appears to be the starting house in New Bark Town. In these games, the player typically needs to:

1. Start by leaving their house
2. Visit Professor Elm's lab (which should be nearby in New Bark Town)
3. Receive their starter Pokémon
4. Begin their Pokémon journey

Since we're at the beginning of the game and don't have a set goal yet, I'll set our initial goal to leave the house and visit Professor Elm to get our first Pokémon. To leave the house, the player needs to move down and interact with the door. Given that we're in the middle of the room, we need to navigate to the bottom of the screen where the exit should be.

Let me use the send_inputs function to move downward, and also set our initial goal.

- A TV and gaming console setup against the back wall
- A small table in the foreground
- A bed or couch on the left side

To leave the house, I'll need to find the exit which is typically on the bottom of the screen. Let me try moving downward to see if we can find the door.
